# Purpose of this Directory
This folder is empty with the expectation being the end user will add files they
wish to source into their bashrc here.

Only files ending with .md (Markdown Extension) will be excluded by default, if
you don't want it to be sourced remove it from this directory or make the file
a hidden file with a leading period.
